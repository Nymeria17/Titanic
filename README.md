# Titanic Dataset Analysis - Chatbot

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic.ipynb`) that performs data analysis and visualization on the Titanic dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The notebook demonstrates how to preprocess the data, apply PCA for dimensionality reduction, and visualize the results.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature selection and standardization
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) implementation
- Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
- Interactive chatbot functionality (to be implemented)

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install the required packages using:
```
pip install jupyter pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `Titanic.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially

## Dataset

The notebook uses the `Titanic-Dataset.csv` file which contains information about Titanic passengers including:
- Age
- Fare
- Pclass
- SibSp
- Parch
- Survived (target variable)

## Chatbot Functionality

The chatbot can help you:
- Understand the dataset structure
- Explain the PCA process
- Interpret the visualization results
- Answer questions about the analysis

To interact with the chatbot, simply run the relevant cells in the notebook.
